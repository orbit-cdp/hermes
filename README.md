# Hermes: Decentralized Perpetual Exchange on Stellar

Hermes is a decentralized perpetual exchange built on the Stellar blockchain, offering traders the ability to trade with up to 100x leverage. Inspired by Jupiter on Solana, Hermes operates on an LP-to-trader model, leveraging liquidity pools and oracles to provide zero price impact, zero slippage, zero spread, and deep liquidity.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into three main directories:

- `contracts/`: Contains the smart contracts for the Hermes exchange.
- `deploy-utils/`: Includes code for deploying the built smart contracts and setting up the oracle.

Each directory has its own README file with more detailed information about its contents and functionality.
